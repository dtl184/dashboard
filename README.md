# dashboard

This repository contains source code necessary to run my dashboard tool. The tool takes a dashcam video, ROS bag file, and records the data playing back on a custom RQt dashboard. It then stitches the dashboard under the dashcam video.

Dependencies: ROS-noetic, Python 3 (I used 3.8.10), RQt (usually installed alongside ROS), FFmpeg
